# Mars-Challenge

Analyze your dataset by using Pandas functions to answer the following questions:

How many months exist on Mars?
  There are 12 months on Mars
  
How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?
 
 1867 days worth of Martian Data were found in the Data

What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)? To answer this question:
  
  The coldest month is the 3rd month and the warmest month is the 8th month.
  
Find the average the minimum daily temperature for all of the months.

About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year? To answer this question:
  there are roughly 675 earth days in a martian year
Consider how many days elapse on Earth in the time that Mars circles the Sun once.
   Mars years are twice as long as earth years.  
Visually estimate the result by plotting the daily minimum temperature.
